Clerk: a Git-like configuration file loader for OCaml
Mickaël Delahaye

* Usage

Simply compile clerk.mli and clerk.ml as any other OCaml file.

Clerk.load "~/.gitconfig";
let user_name = Clerk.get_string "user.name";;

* Configuration file format

See man git-config.

cat > test.config <<EOF
[Section1]
  a =              true
  b = X\
Y\
Z

[section1 "Subsection A"]
  N = 1

[section2.subSECTION-B]
  t = yes
EOF

Clerk.load "test.config"
Clerk.get_bool "section1.a" (* lower case for section *)
-> true
Clerk.get_bool "section1.a" (* lower case for section *)
-> true
Clerk.get_int "section1.Subsection A.n" (* lower case for variable *)
-> 1
Clerk.get_string "section1.Subsection A.n" (* lower case for variable *)
-> 1
Clerk.get_bool "section1.subsection-b.t" (* lower case for unquoted subsection *)
-> true (* yes, on, and 1 are true, whereas no, off, and 0 are false *)


* WARNING

Hardly tested and only under Linux!
